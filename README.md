**This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions for basic image-processing tasks like image manipulation, image enhancement, image segmentation, and many more. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn image processing with MATLAB or an experienced user seeking reference code, you'll find various examples and tutorials here.**

## Prerequisites
Before using the code in this repository, make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system. You can download MATLAB from the [official MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/) or you can use the online MATLAB with some restrictions of usage from the [online MATLAB 1](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) or [online MATLAB 2](https://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html).
No additional installation is required for these MATLAB scripts apart from MATLAB software. Simply open MATLAB and run the scripts as needed.

## Getting Started
To start using the codes, you will need some images; though you can take any image, I have provided some standard MATLAB images that you can use. You can download it from [here.](https://github.com/santoshpanda1995/Image-Processing-using-Matlab/tree/main/Images)
